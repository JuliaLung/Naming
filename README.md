# Choosing Names

Names work well when they simpilfy collaboration with one who shares your expertise and another who works in a different field.  It is much simpler to explain the function `facial_recognition` than to explain that function were it named `facer`.  Where there are many important types and functions, the potential for successful and smooth collaboration rides with the elegance and coherence of their names.

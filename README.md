# Choosing Names

Names work well when they simpilfy collaboration with one who shares your expertise and another who works in a different field.  It is much simpler to explain the function `facial_recognition` than to explain that function were it named `facer`.  The potential for successful and smooth collaboration rides meaningfully with the elegance and coherence of the names of things.
